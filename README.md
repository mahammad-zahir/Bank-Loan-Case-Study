# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to a dataset containing loan application data from a finance company. The primary goal is to identify key patterns and attributes that influence loan default, helping the company make better loan approval decisions and reduce financial risks.

Key Tasks:
Missing Data Handling: Detect and impute missing values using Excel functions.
Outlier Detection: Identify outliers in numerical variables with statistical techniques like IQR.
Data Imbalance Analysis: Examine the class distribution of loan statuses and assess data imbalance.
Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Explore variable distributions and relationships using Excel pivot tables and charts.
Correlation Analysis: Find top correlations between customer/loan attributes and default risk.
This project provides a structured approach to risk analysis in financial services, offering data-driven insights for loan approvals.
